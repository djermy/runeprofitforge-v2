[Things To Note]

- I am not liable for any GP loss from misuse of these calculators,
  the prices given are based on the value of the item at time of calculation.
- All calculators assume the mk2 versions.
- Beware the database is outdated, it contains items on the GE from around september 2023,
  so newer items are not available for calculations.
- The calculators retrieve the current GE price of items so calculations are still accurate.
